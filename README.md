# CI/CD native Android Mobile App
In this project there are 3 different branches, apart from the dev branch.

These branches aim to test different CI/CD tools for mobile app programming. 

Bitrise, Codemagic and Jenkins were tested with this simple Android native Jetpack Compose app and all three tools were implemented with the same pipeline and test cases as far as possible.
